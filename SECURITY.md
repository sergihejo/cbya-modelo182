# Security Policy

This project prioritises the security of the data:
* Data is **NOT stored**: **Sensible data** such as NIF/CIF, names, phones or adresses are **not stored on disk**. They are only used during the conversion.
* Data **validation**: Validations are done, in both frontend and backend, to asure that the input data is correct and consistent.
